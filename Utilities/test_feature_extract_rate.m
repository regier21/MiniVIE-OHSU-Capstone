% Objective is to compare the feature extraction at different sample rates.
%  in both cases the desire is to extract 150 ms of data and extract
%  features.  Signal 1 is sampled at 1000Hz and Signal 2 at 300Hz.  Results
%  differ by as much as 20% for curve length.
%
% Additionally, simple upsampling via interp1 can cause additional
% variation as original peaks are not recovered and MAV declines on time
% resample.  'resample' function does a better job but is ~5x slower
